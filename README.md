## About

## Installation

To install, from the parent directory of the project, use the command

## Usage

#### Preliminary note:

We believe tests are a powerful documentation tool. Looking at the tests (inside the test directory) or at the help for the executable scripts is recommended in case information on usage not found here is required.

    python playing_around/get_word.py
